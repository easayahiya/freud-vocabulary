Such action generally displays an impulsive aspect relatively out of harmony with the subjectâ€™s usual motivational patterns, and fairly easy to isolate from the overall trends of his activity. Acting out often takes the form of aggressive behaviour directed either at the self or at others. When it occurs in the course of analysisâ€“whether during the actual session or notâ€“acting out should be understood in its relationship to the <a class="internal-link broken">transference</a>, and often as a basic refusal to acknowledge this transference.
â€˜Agieren,â€™ a term of Latin origin which Freud uses both verbally and substantially, is not a part of German common usage. For referring to action or acting German prefers such words as â€˜die Tatâ€™ â€˜tunâ€™, â€˜die Wirkungâ€™ etc. Freud employs â€˜agieren â€™ transitivelyâ€“as he does â€˜abreagierenâ€™, which has the same root (see â€˜Abreactionâ€™); its object (i.e. what is â€˜acted outâ€™) is instincts, phantasies, wishes, etc.
â€˜Agierenâ€™ is nearly always coupled with â€˜<a class="internal-link broken">erinnern</a>, to remember, the two being contrasting ways of bringing the past into the present.
Freud observed this contrast essentially in the context of the treatment, with the result that it is repetition in the transference that he most often refers to as â€˜acting outâ€™: the patient â€˜acts it before us, as it were, instead of reporting it to usâ€™ (la). Acting out extends beyond the transference proper, however: â€˜We must be prepared to find, therefore, that the patient yields to the compulsion to <a class="internal-link broken">repeat</a>, which now replaces the compulsion to remember, not only in his personal attitude to his doctor but also in every other activity and relationship which may occupy his life at the timeâ€“if, for instance, he falls in love or undertakes a task or starts an enterprise during the treatmentâ€™ (2).
The term â€˜acting outâ€™ enshrines an ambiguity that is actually intrinsic to Freudâ€™s thinking here: he fails to distinguish the element of actualisation in the transference from the resort to motor actionâ€“which the transference (q.v.) does not necessarily entail. It is hard to see, for example, how Freud was able to go on being satisfied, as a way of accounting for repetition in the transference, with the metapsychological model of motility he had put forward as early as The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a): â€˜â€¦the fact of transference, as well as the psychoses, show us that [unconscious wishes] endeavour to force their way by way of the preconscious system into consciousness and to obtain control of the power of movementâ€™ (3).
The confusion may be further illustrated by the following definition of acting out, offered by English and English in their Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms :â€˜manifesting the purposive behaviour appropriate to an older situation in a new situation which symbolically represents it. Cf. transference, which is a form of acting out.â€™ This definition conflicts with the most commonly held psycho-analytic view, which treats the domain of the transference and recourse to acting out as distinct if not actually opposed to one another, the latter being looked upon as an attempt to break off the analytic relationship.</p><hr><p>From the descriptive point of view, the range of actions ordinarily classified as acting out is very wide. At one pole are violent, aggressive and criminal actsâ€“murder, suicide, sexual assault, etc.â€“where the subject is deemed to proceed from an idea or tendency to the corresponding act (the passage Ã  lâ€™acte of French clinical psychiatry); at the other extreme we find much more subdued formsâ€“although the impulsive aspect must still be evident: the act is ill-motivated even in the subjectâ€™s own eyes, constituting a radical departure from his usual behaviour even if he rationalises it after the fact. For the psycho-analyst indications such as these betoken the <a class="internal-link broken">return of the repressed</a>. Also placed under the rubric of acting out are certain accidents which befall subjects who feel they have no part in bringing them about. Giving such a broad connotation to â€˜acting outâ€™ naturally makes a problem of the conceptâ€™s delimitation: it has only been marked off from other concepts forged by Freud (notably from <a class="internal-link broken">parapraxis</a> and so-called repetition phenomena) in a manner which tends to be vague and to vary from one author to the next (Î±). Parapraxes too are sharply distinct and isolated, butâ€“at any rate in the most prototypical formâ€“their nature as <a class="internal-link broken">compromise formations</a> is patent. By contrast, in lived-out repetition phenomena (e.g. â€˜fate compulsionsâ€™), the repressed contents often return in a scenario of great fidelity whose authorship the subject fails to recognise as his own.</p><hr><p>One of the achievements of psycho-analysis has been to bring the occurrence of specific impulsive acts into relation with the dynamics of the treatment and the transference. This line of advance was clearly indicated by Freud when he underscored the tendency of certain patients to â€˜act outâ€™ the instinctual impulses aroused during the analytic session outside the consulting room. But inasmuch as Freud, as we have seen, describes even transference on to the analyst as a modality of acting out, he fails either to differentiate clearly or to show the interconnections between repetition phenomena in the transference on the one hand and manifestations of acting out on the other. The distinction he does propose is apparently meant as a solution to problems of a predominantly technical nature: the subject who acts out conflicts outside the treatment has less chance of becoming aware of their repetitive character and he is in a position, since he is free of any control or interpretation by the analyst, to satisfy his repressed instincts to the limitâ€“i.e. to complete the act in question: â€˜We think it most undesirable if the patient acts (agiert) outside the transference instead of remembering. The ideal conduct for our purposes would be that he should behave as normally as possible outside the treatment and express his abnormal reactions only in the transferenceâ€™ (lb).
One of the outstanding tasks of psycho-analysis is to ground the distinction between transference and acting out on criteria other than purely technical onesâ€“or even mere considerations of locale (does something happen within the consulting room or not?). This task presupposes a reformulation of the concepts of action and actualisation and a fresh definition of the different modalities of communication.
Only when the relations between acting out and the analytic transference have been theoretically clarified will it be possible to see whether the structures thus exposed can be extrapolated from the frame of reference of the treatmentâ€“to decide, in other words, whether light can be shed on the impulsive acts of everyday life by linking them to relationships of the transference type.
(Î±) Such a demarcation has to be made if the notion of acting out is to preserve any specificity and escape assimilation into a generalised conception which does no more than point up the more or less close relationship that exists between any human project and unconscious phantasies.</p><p>(1) FREUD, S.
