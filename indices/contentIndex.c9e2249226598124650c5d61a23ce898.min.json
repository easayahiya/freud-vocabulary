Abreaction may be provoked in the course of psychotherapy, especially under hypnosis, and produce a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] effect. It may also come about spontaneously, either a short or a long interval after the original [[trauma]].\nThe notion of abreaction can only be understood by reference to Freud’s theory of the genesis of the hysterical symptom, as set out in his paper ‘On the Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena’ (1893a) (la, a). The persistence of the affect attached to a memory depends on several factors, of which the most important is related to the way in which the subject has reacted to a particular event. Such a reaction may be composed of voluntary or involuntary responses, and may range in nature from tears to acts of revenge. Where this reaction is of sufficient intensity a large part of the affect associated with the event disappears; it is when the reaction is [[Suppression|suppressed]] (unterdrückt) that the affect remains [[Binding|bound]] to the memory.\nAbreaction is thus the normal way for the subject to react to an event and to ensure that it does not keep too great a quota of [[affect]]. For the reaction to be cathartic, however, it has to be ‘adequate’.\nAbreaction may be spontaneous; in other words, it may come about fairly shortly after the event and prevent the memory from being so burdened with a great quota of affect that it becomes pathogenic. Alternatively, it may be secondary, precipitated by a cathartic psychotherapy which enables the patient to recall the traumatic event, to put it into words and so deliver himself from the weight of affect which has been the cause of his pathological condition. As early as 1895, in fact, Freud noted that ‘language serves as a substitute for action; by its help, an affect can be “abreacted” almost as effectively’ (1b).\nA massive abreaction is not the only way for a subject to get rid of the memory of a traumatic event; the memory may be integrated into a series of associations which allows the event to be corrected–to be put in its proper place. From the Studies on Hysteria(1895d) onwards, we find Freud speaking on occasion of the actual effort of recollection and mental working out’ as a process of abreaction in which the same affect is revived at the memory of each of the different events which have given rise to it (1c).\nThe effect of an absence of abreaction is the persistence of the groups of [[Idea (or Presentation or Representation)|ideas]] which lie at the root of neurotic symptoms; they remain unconscious and isolated from the normal course of thought: ‘… the ideas which have become pathological have persisted with such freshness and affective strength because they have been denied the normal wearing-away processes by means of abreaction and reproduction in states of uninhibited association’ (1d).\nBreuer and Freud were concerned to identify the different sets of conditions which prevent the subject from abreacting. They felt that in certain cases these sets of conditions were related not to the nature of the event, but rather to the mental state of the subject at the moment of its occurrence: [[fright]], autohypnosis or [[hypnoid state]]. Alternatively, their origin was sometimes to be found in the circumstances–usually of a social nature–which oblige the subject to restrain his reactions. A final possibility was that there were ‘things which the patient wished to forget, and therefore intentionally repressed from his conscious thought and inhibited and suppressed’ (le). These three different sets of conditions defined the three types of hysteria: hypnoid [[hysteria]], [[retention hysteria]] and [[defence hysteria]]. It was immediately after the publication of the Studies on Hysteria that Freud abandoned the first two of these three types.\n* * *\n\nThe exclusive emphasis on abreaction as the key to psychotherapeutic effectiveness is above all typical of the period in Freud’s work which is known as the period of the cathartic method. Yet the notion is retained in the later theory of psycho-analytic treatment. There are empirical reasons for its survival, for every cure involves manifest emotional discharge, though to varying degrees according to the type of patient. There are theoretical reasons too, in so far as every theory of the cure must take into account [[repetition]] as well as recollection. Concepts such as [[transference]], [[working-through]] and [[acting out]] all imply some reference to the theory of abreaction, even though they also lead us to more complex conceptions of treatment than the idea of a pure and simple elimination of the traumatising affect.\n(α) The neologism ‘abreagieren’ seems to have been coined by Freud and Breuer from the verb reagieren in its transitive use and the prefix ab-, which has several meanings, particularly distance in time, the fact of separation, diminishment, suppression etc.\n(1) BREUER, J. and FREUD, S.: a)Cf.

The implication for the analyst is that he should refuse on principle to satisfy the patient’s demands and to fulfil the roles which the patient tends to impose upon Hia En certain cases, and at certain moments during the treatment, the rule of abstinence may be given explicit expression in tine form of advice about the patient’s repetitive behaviour which is hindering the work of recollection and the [[working out]].\nThe justification for the rule of abstinence is of an essentially [[economic]] order. The analyst must make sure that the quantities of libido released by the treatment are not immediately redirected towards a fresh cathexis of external objects; they must so far as possible be transferred into the analytic situation. The libidinal energy is thus monopolised by the [[transference]] and deprived of any occasion for discharge other than through verbal expression.\n\nFrom the [[dynamic]] point of view, the treatment relies basically on the existence of suffering brought about by frustration–a suffering which tends to decrease as the symptoms are replaced by more satisfying substitutive behaviour. The important thing, therefore, is to maintain or to re-establish the frustration so as to assure the progress of the treatment.\nImplicitly, the notion of abstinence is linked to the whole principle of the analytic method, in that [[interpretation]] is its fundamental aim–not the gratification of the patient’s libidinal demands. It should come as no surprise that when Freud tackles the question of abstinence directly, in 1915, it is apropos of a particularly pressing demand–the one inevitably associated with transference-love: ‘I shall state it as a fundamental principle that the patient’s need and longing should be allowed to persist in her, in order that they may serve as forces impelling her to do work and to make changes, and that we must beware of appeasing these forces by means of surrogates’ (1).\n\nIt was with Ferenczi that the technical problems posed by the observance of the rule of abstinence were to come to the forefront of psycho-analytic debate. In certain cases, Freud maintained, measures should be taken which tend to drive away the surrogate satisfactions which the patient finds both within the treatment and outside it. In his concluding address to the Budapest Congress of 1918, Freud approved such measures on principle and offered a theoretical justification for them: ‘Cruel though it may sound, we must see to it that the patient’s suffering, to a degree that is in some way or other effective, does not come to an end prematurely. If, owing to the symptoms having been taken apart, and having lost their value, his suffering becomes mitigated, we must re-instate it elsewhere in the form of some appreciable privation’ (2).\n\nThe notion of abstinence is still the subject of debate. In our opinion, it is worth while drawing a clear distinction here between abstinence as a rule to be followed by the analyst–a simple consequence of his [[neutrality]]–and those [[Active Technique|active measures]] which he takes in order to get the patient to abstain from certain things of his own accord. Such measures range from interpretations whose persistent repetition makes them tantamount to injunctions, to categorical prohibitions. The latter, when they are not designed to forbid the patient all sexual relations, are usually directed against specific forms of sexual activity (perversions) or specific manœuvres of a repetitive character which seem to be paralysing the work of analysis. The majority of analysts have serious reservations about recourse to active measures of this type–notably on the grounds that in this way the analyst may with justice be accused of expressing repressive authority.\n\n(1) FREUD, S,, G.W., X, 313; S.E., XII, 165.\n(2) FREUD, S. ‘Lines of Advance in Psycho-Analytic Therapy’ (1919a [1918]), G.W., XII, 188; S.E., XVII, 163.","lastmodified":"2022-05-24T13:48:18.782368329Z","tags":null},"/notes/Acting-Out":{"title":"Acting Out","content":"\n= D.: Agieren.–Es.: actuar.–Fr.: mise en acte; acting out.–I: agire.–P.: agir\n\nAccording to Freud, action in which the subject, in the grip of his unconscious wishes and phantasies, relives these in the present with a sensation of immediacy which is heightened by his refusal to recognise their source and their repetitive character.\nSuch action generally displays an impulsive aspect relatively out of harmony with the subject’s usual motivational patterns, and fairly easy to isolate from the overall trends of his activity. Acting out often takes the form of aggressive behaviour directed either at the self or at others. When it occurs in the course of analysis–whether during the actual session or not–acting out should be understood in its relationship to the [[transference]], and often as a basic refusal to acknowledge this transference.\n‘Agieren,’ a term of Latin origin which Freud uses both verbally and substantially, is not a part of German common usage. For referring to action or acting German prefers such words as ‘die Tat’ ‘tun’, ‘die Wirkung’ etc. Freud employs ‘agieren ’ transitively–as he does ‘abreagieren’, which has the same root (see ‘Abreaction’); its object (i.e. what is ‘acted out’) is instincts, phantasies, wishes, etc.\n‘Agieren’ is nearly always coupled with ‘[[memory-trace|erinnern]], to remember, the two being contrasting ways of bringing the past into the present.\nFreud observed this contrast essentially in the context of the treatment, with the result that it is repetition in the transference that he most often refers to as ‘acting out’: the patient ‘acts it before us, as it were, instead of reporting it to us’ (la). Acting out extends beyond the transference proper, however: ‘We must be prepared to find, therefore, that the patient yields to the compulsion to [[repetition|repeat]], which now replaces the compulsion to remember, not only in his personal attitude to his doctor but also in every other activity and relationship which may occupy his life at the time–if, for instance, he falls in love or undertakes a task or starts an enterprise during the treatment’ (2).\nThe term ‘acting out’ enshrines an ambiguity that is actually intrinsic to Freud’s thinking here: he fails to distinguish the element of actualisation in the transference from the resort to motor action–which the transference (q.v.) does not necessarily entail. It is hard to see, for example, how Freud was able to go on being satisfied, as a way of accounting for repetition in the transference, with the metapsychological model of motility he had put forward as early as The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a): ‘…the fact of transference, as well as the psychoses, show us that [unconscious wishes] endeavour to force their way by way of the preconscious system into consciousness and to obtain control of the power of movement’ (3).\nThe confusion may be further illustrated by the following definition of acting out, offered by English and English in their Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms :‘manifesting the purposive behaviour appropriate to an older situation in a new situation which symbolically represents it. Cf. transference, which is a form of acting out.’ This definition conflicts with the most commonly held psycho-analytic view, which treats the domain of the transference and recourse to acting out as distinct if not actually opposed to one another, the latter being looked upon as an attempt to break off the analytic relationship.\n* * *\n\nFrom the descriptive point of view, the range of actions ordinarily classified as acting out is very wide. At one pole are violent, aggressive and criminal acts–murder, suicide, sexual assault, etc.–where the subject is deemed to proceed from an idea or tendency to the corresponding act (the passage à l’acte of French clinical psychiatry); at the other extreme we find much more subdued forms–although the impulsive aspect must still be evident: the act is ill-motivated even in the subject’s own eyes, constituting a radical departure from his usual behaviour even if he rationalises it after the fact. For the psycho-analyst indications such as these betoken the [[return of the repressed]]. Also placed under the rubric of acting out are certain accidents which befall subjects who feel they have no part in bringing them about. Giving such a broad connotation to ‘acting out’ naturally makes a problem of the concept’s delimitation: it has only been marked off from other concepts forged by Freud (notably from [[parapraxis]] and so-called repetition phenomena) in a manner which tends to be vague and to vary from one author to the next (α). Parapraxes too are sharply distinct and isolated, but–at any rate in the most prototypical form–their nature as [[compromise-formation|compromise formations]] is patent. By contrast, in lived-out repetition phenomena (e.g. ‘fate compulsions’), the repressed contents often return in a scenario of great fidelity whose authorship the subject fails to recognise as his own.\n* * *\n\nOne of the achievements of psycho-analysis has been to bring the occurrence of specific impulsive acts into relation with the dynamics of the treatment and the transference. This line of advance was clearly indicated by Freud when he underscored the tendency of certain patients to ‘act out’ the instinctual impulses aroused during the analytic session outside the consulting room. But inasmuch as Freud, as we have seen, describes even transference on to the analyst as a modality of acting out, he fails either to differentiate clearly or to show the interconnections between repetition phenomena in the transference on the one hand and manifestations of acting out on the other. The distinction he does propose is apparently meant as a solution to problems of a predominantly technical nature: the subject who acts out conflicts outside the treatment has less chance of becoming aware of their repetitive character and he is in a position, since he is free of any control or interpretation by the analyst, to satisfy his repressed instincts to the limit–i.e. to complete the act in question: ‘We think it most undesirable if the patient acts (agiert) outside the transference instead of remembering. The ideal conduct for our purposes would be that he should behave as normally as possible outside the treatment and express his abnormal reactions only in the transference’ (lb).\nOne of the outstanding tasks of psycho-analysis is to ground the distinction between transference and acting out on criteria other than purely technical ones–or even mere considerations of locale (does something happen within the consulting room or not?). This task presupposes a reformulation of the concepts of action and actualisation and a fresh definition of the different modalities of communication.\nOnly when the relations between acting out and the analytic transference have been theoretically clarified will it be possible to see whether the structures thus exposed can be extrapolated from the frame of reference of the treatment–to decide, in other words, whether light can be shed on the impulsive acts of everyday life by linking them to relationships of the transference type.\n(α) Such a demarcation has to be made if the notion of acting out is to preserve any specificity and escape assimilation into a generalised conception which does no more than point up the more or less close relationship that exists between any human project and unconscious phantasies.\n\n\n(1) FREUD, S.

Ferenczi first raised the topic in connection with larval forms of masturbation which are encountered in the analysis of cases of hysteria and which it is desirable to prohibit; indeed the patient may ‘attach all his pathogenic phantasies to them, short-circuit them constantly by motor discharge, and thus save himself the irksome and unpleasant task of bringing them to consciousness’ (la). Ferenczi stresses that recourse to prohibitions of this kind is intended solely to help get out of dead ends in the work of analysis; and he invokes the precedent set by Freud when he enjoined phobic patients, at a certain point in their analysis, to confront the phobia-producing situation (1b, 2).\n\nAt the 1920 Congress in The Hague, encouraged by approval from Freud, who had formulated the rule of [[Abstinence (Rule of)|abstinence]] at the Budapest Congress the year before, Ferenczi presented an overview of his active therapy. This comprises two phases which are supposed to permit the activation and control of erotic tendencies–even where these have been sublimated. The first of these phases consists of injunctions designed to transform repressed instinctual impulses into a manifest satisfaction, so making them into fully conscious formations. The second one consists of prohibitions regarding these same formations; by this time the analyst is able to relate the activities and affects brought out by the first phase to infantile situations.\n\nTheoretically speaking, the resort to active measures is justified as follows: in contrast to the [[Cathartic Method (or Therapy)]], where the emergence of a memory brings on an emotional reaction, the active method, by provoking [[Acting Out|acting out]] and the manifestation of the [[affect]], facilitates the [[return of the repressed]]. ‘It is […] possible that certain early infantile […] contents […] can not be simply remembered at all, but can only be reproduced by a re-living’ (3).\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Ferenczi considers that one should resort to active measures only in exceptional cases, for a very limited time, solely if the transference has become a compulsion, and mainly towards the end of the treatment. Finally, he stresses that he intends no modification of the [[fundamental rule]]:.instead, the ‘artifices’ he suggests are meant to make it easier to observe the rule.\nLater on, Ferenczi considerably broadened the scope of active measures (4). In a short work written in collaboration with Otto Rank, The Development of Psycho-Analysis (1924), he offers an interpretation of the progress of the treatment in terms of the libido which makes a resort to active measures (the laying down of a deadline for the ending of the treatment) a necessity, especially in the final stage (the stage of ‘weaning from the libido’).\n\nFerenczi was eventually to reverse himself on this point. His final view was that active measures considerably increase the patient’s resistances; by formulating injunctions and prohibitions the analyst plays the part of a parental super-ego, or even of a schoolmaster; as for fixing a deadline for bringing the treatment to a close, the setbacks met with here show that this procedure is rarely called for, and only if the patient agrees with it and if the possibility of revoking the deadline is left open (this goes too for any active measures envisaged) (5). Ferenczi finally abandoned the promotion of active measures entirely: ‘…we must content ourselves with interpreting the patient’s concealed tendencies to action and supporting his feeble attempts to overcome the neurotic inhibitions to which he had hitherto been subject, without pressing or even advising him to take violent measures. If we are patient enough, the patient will himself sooner or later come up with the question whether he should risk making some effort, for example to defy a phobic avoidance. […] In other words, it is the patient himself who must decide the timing of activity, or at any rate give unmistakable indications that the time is ripe for it’ (6).\n\nThe active technique is often contrasted with the purely expectant and passive attitude supposedly required by the analytic method. Actually this opposition is forced: for one thing, Ferenczi persistently treated the techniques he proposed as auxiliary to analysis, not as a variant form of it; and further, the analytic method itself does not rule out a certain amount of activity on the part of the analyst (questions, spacing out of the sessions, etc.), and interpretation is active inasmuch as it inevitably has an effect on the flow of associations. The hallmark of active technique is the stress it lays on [[repetition]] in the sense in which Freud contrasted it to remembering: in order to overcome the compulsion to repeat and at last make recollection possible–or at least let the treatment proceed–Ferenczi judged it needful not merely to permit but actually to encourage repetition. This is the basis of the active technique (α).\n(α) For a fuller discussion of the subject the reader is referred to Glover’s Technique of Psychoanalysis (1955) (7), which shows that the questions opened by Ferenczi are not yet resolved.\n\n(1) FERENCZI, S. ‘Technical Difficulties in the Analysis of a Case of Hysteria’ (1919), in Further Contributions: a) 193. b) Cf. 196.\n(2) Cf.

Activity and passivity sure the defining characteristics of specific types of [[aim of the instinct, instinctual aim|instinctual aims]]. From the genetic point of view the active-passive dichotomy is prior to the subsequent oppositions between phallic and castrated, [[masculinity, femininity|masculine and feminine]], which eventually subsume it.\n\nAlthough activity and passivity are principally seen in Freud’s terms as attributes of the modalities of instinctual life, it does not follow that there is a corollary distinction to be made between active and passive instincts. On the contrary, Freud was concerned to emphasise–particularly on the occasion of his polemic with Adler (see ‘Aggressive Instinct’)–that being active was itself a defining quality of the instincts: ‘Every instinct is a piece of activity; if we speak loosely of passive instincts, we can only mean instincts whose aim is passive’ (la).\n\nPsycho-analysts may observe this passivity of the aim in the special instances of people who want to be ill-treated (masochism) or to be seen (exhibitionism). If we are to understand what is meant by passivity here, we should distinguish between two levels: the level of explicit behaviour and the level of the underlying phantasies. It is certain that the masochist’s behaviour, for example, is the expression of a response to instinctual demands–in other words, it is an activity aiming to get him into a situation which provides satisfaction. Yet the final stage of this behaviour is not attained unless the subject manages to take up a position in which he is at the mercy of the other. It can be shown how, at the phantasy level, every passive position is in fact inseparable from its opposite; thus, in masochism, ‘the passive ego places itself back in phantasy in its first role, which has now in fact been taken over by the extraneous subject’ (1b). In a similar way it is always possible to discover the simultaneous or alternating presence, at the phantasy level, of the two poles of activity and passivity. All the same, when we are considering the type of satisfaction looked for, just as when we turn our attention to the position sought in phantasy, this complementarity must not be allowed to obscure the real measure of ineradicable attachment which may be present in the subject’s fixation to an active or a passive sexual role.\n\nAs far as the development of the subject is concerned, Freud assigns an important part to the opposition of activity and passivity, which precedes two other oppositions–those between phallic and castrated and between masculinity and femininity. At the [[Anal-Sadistic Stage (or Phase)|anal stage]], Freud maintains, ‘the opposition between two currents, which runs through all sexual life, is already developed […]. The activity is put into operation by the [[instinct for mastery]] through the agency of the somatic musculature; the organ which, more than any other, represents the passive sexual aim is the erotogenic mucous membrane’ (2). This does not mean that activity and passivity do not coexist during the [[oral stage|oral phase]], but simply that they have not yet emerged as antagonistic poles.\n\nRuth Mack Brunswick, in her description of ‘The Preoedipal Phase of the Libido Development’ (1940), has this to say: ‘Three great pairs of antitheses exist throughout the entire libido development, mingling, overlapping and combining, never wholly coinciding, and ultimately replacing one another. Infancy and childhood are characterised by the first two, and adolescence by the third’ (3a). She shows how the child starts by being totally passive in its role towards a mother who satisfies its needs, and how, gradually, ‘each bit of activity is based to some extent on an identification with the active mother’ (3b).\n\n(1) FREUD, S. ‘Instincts and their Vicissitudes’ (1915c): a) G.W., X, 214–15; S.E., XIV, 122. b) G.W., X, 220; S.E., XIV, 128.\n(2) FREUD, S.

The origin of the actual neuroses is not to be found in infantile conflicts, tot in the present.\nb. The symptoms here, instead of being a symbolic and overdetermined from of expression, are the direct outcome of the absence or inadequacy of sexual satisfaction.\n\nAt first Freud considered that [[anxiety neurosis]] and [[neurasthenia]] made up the actual neuroses, but he later proposed that hypochondria should be counted among them.\nThe term ‘actual neurosis’ appears for the first time in Freud’s work in 1898, when it is used to denote anxiety neurosis and neurasthenia (1a). The idea that these conditions were to be set apart from the other neuroses had been developed much earlier, however, during his researches into the aetiology of the neuroses, as can be seen from both the correspondence with Fliess (2) and the writings of 1894–96 (3).\na. The opposition between the actual neuroses and the psychoneuroses is essentially aetiological and pathogenic: the cause is definitely sexual in both these types of neurosis, but in the former case it must be sought in ‘a disorder of [the subject’s] contemporary sexual life’ and not in ‘important events in his past life’ (4). The adjective ‘actual’ is therefore to be understood first and foremost in the sense of temporal ‘actuality’ (1b) [a sense which has largely been abandoned by modern English usage–tr.]. In addition, this aetiology is somatic rather than psychical: ‘…the source of excitation, the precipitating cause of the disturbance, lies in the somatic field instead of the psychical one, as is the case in hysteria and obsessional neurosis’ (5). In anxiety neurosis, this precipitating cause is considered to be the non-discharge of sexual excitation, while in neurasthenia it is the incomplete satisfaction of it, as in masturbation, which is held to be responsible.\nLastly, the mechanism of [[symptom-formation]] is taken to be somatic in the actual neuroses (as when there is a direct transformation of the excitation into anxiety); so that ‘actual’ connotes the absence of the mediations which are to be encountered in the symptom-formation of the psychoneuroses (displacement, condensation, etc.).\nFrom the therapeutic standpoint, the upshot of these views is that the actual neuroses cannot be treated psycho-analytically because their symptoms do not have a meaning that can be elucidated (6).\nFreud never abandons this position in respect of the actual neuroses. He puts it forward on a number of occasions, remarking that the explanation of the mechanism of symptom-formation in these cases can be left to the chemical sciences (intoxication of the sexual substances by products of the metabolism) (7).\nb. There is, in Freud’s view, more than an overall antithesis opposing the psychoneuroses to the actual neuroses: he attempts several times to establish a thoroughgoing isomorphism between neurasthenia and anxiety neurosis on the one hand and the various [[transference neurosis|transference neuroses]] on the other. When he later introduces hypochondria into the class of the actual neuroses (8), he sees it as corresponding to the [[paraphrenia|paraphrenias]] or [[narcissistic libido|narcissistic neuroses]] (schizophrenia and paranoia). These parallels are not justified only by structural analogies, but also by the fact that ‘a symptom of an “actual” neurosis is often the nucleus and first stage of a [[symptom-formation|psychoneurotic symptom]] (9). The idea that psychoneurosis is precipitated by frustration leading to the damming-up of the libido serves in effect to emphasize the presence of the ‘actual’ element (10).\n* * *\n\nThe concept of actual neurosis is tending to disappear from present-day nosography. This is due to the fact that it is always possible–however important the actual factors may be as precipitating causes–to detect the symbolic expression of older conflicts in the symptoms. Which said, the idea of actual conflicts and symptoms has conserved its utility; it is an idea which calls for some comment:\na. Psycho-analytic practice brings out the necessity to distinguish between those conflicts of infantile origin which are reactualised, and those which are principally determined by an actual (present) situation: the existence of an acute actual conflict can often present an obstacle to progress in the course of the psycho-analytic treatment.\nb. In every psychoneurosis a longer or shorter catalogue of symptoms will be met with, alongside those with an explicable significance, which are of the type described by Freud in the context of the actual neuroses: unjustifiable fatigue, vague pains and so on. Where the defensive conflict is preventing the fulfilment of unconscious wishes, it is conceivable that this libido which has not been satisfied is at the root of a certain number of non-specific symptoms.\nc. To pursue this line of thought, it may be remarked that according to Freud’s view of the matter ‘actual’ symptoms are chiefly somatic in character, so that the old idea of actual neurosis leads directly to the present-day conception of psychosomatic troubles.\nd. As a last point, it is worth noting that it is only the lack of satisfaction of the sexual instincts which is taken into consideration by Freud’s theory. In attempting to understand the genesis of actual and psychosomatic symptoms, we should be well advised to pay some attention too to the suppression of aggressiveness.\n\n\n(1) Cf.

Adhesiveness is said to vary from individual to individual.\nIn Freud’s writings several kindred terms are used to designate this property of the libido: Haftbarkeit (adhesiveness) or Fähigkeit zur Fixierung (susceptibility to fixation), Zähigkeit (pertinacity), Klebrigkeit (viscosity), Trägheit (inertia).\nThe last two terms in this list are those most readily called upon by Freud. It is noteworthy that words like ‘viscosity’ and ‘adhesiveness’ evoke the Freudian image of the libido as a flow of liquid. In introducing the idea of the fixation of libido in the Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905d), Freud assumes the existence of a factor which, taken in conjunction with an accidental experience, is able to explain the intensity of a fixation (see ‘Complemental Series’): ‘a psychical factor of unknown origin’, ‘an increased pertinacity or susceptibility to fixation’ which is characteristic of ‘these early impressions of sexual life’ (1).\nFreud maintains this view all the way through his work. There are two contexts in particular where he sets it forth:\na. On the theoretical level, when the evolution of childhood sexuality and its fixations has to be traced–notably in ‘From the History of an Infantile Neurosis’ (19186 [1914]): ‘Any position of the libido which [the Wolf Man] had once taken up was obstinately defended by him from fear of what he would lose by giving it up and from distrust of the probability of a complete substitute being afforded by the new position that was in view. This is an important and fundamental psychological peculiarity, which I described in my Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality as susceptibility to “fixation” ’ (2a).\nb. In the theory of the treatment, where it connotes one of the limits of therapeutic action: ‘The processes which the treatment sets in motion in [certain subjects] are so much slower than in other people because, apparently, they cannot make up their minds to detach libidinal cathexes from one object and displace them on to another, although we can discover no special reason for this cathectic loyalty’ (3).\nFreud further notes that an excessive libidinal mobility may create just the reverse problem, in which event the achievements of the treatment may be very precarious.\nIn the last analysis, then, how does Freud conceive of this viscosity, this susceptibility to fixation which can be a major obstacle in therapy? He sees it as in some way irreducible, as ‘a prime number’ (2b), an element which is unanalysable and which it is impossible to change; for the most part he defines it as a constitutional factor which the process of ageing tends to accentuate.\nThe adhesiveness of libido seems to bear witness to a sort of psychical inertia analogous to entropy in a physical system: in transformations of psychical energy there is apparently never any way of mobilising a whole quantity of energy that has once become fixated. It is in this sense that Freud uses the Jungian expression ‘psychical inertia’ on occasion, in spite of his stated reservations about the excessive explanatory value accorded this notion by Jung in his account of the aetiology of the neuroses.\n\n(1) FREUD, S., G.W., V, 144; S.E., VII, 242.\n(2) FREUD, S., a) G.W., XII, 151; S.E., XVII, 115. b) G.W.,XII, 151; S.E., XVII, 116.\n(3) FREUD, S. ‘Analysis Terminable and Interminable’ (1937c), G.W., XVI, 87; S.E., XXIII, 241.","lastmodified":"2022-05-24T13:48:18.782368329Z","tags":null},"/notes/Affect":{"title":"Affect","content":"= D.: Affekt.–Es.: afecto.–Fr.: affect.–I.: affetto.–P.: afeto.\n\nTerm borrowed by psycho-analysis from German psychological usage. It connotes any affective state, whether painful or pleasant, whether vague or well defined, and whether it is manifested in the form of a massive discharge or in the form of a general mood. According to Freud, each instinct expresses itself in terms of affect and in terms of [[Idea (or Presentation or Representation)|ideas]] (Vorstellungen). The affect is the qualitative expression of the quantity of instinctual energy and of its fluctuations.\n\nThe notion of affect takes on a great deal of importance as early as Breuer’s and Freud’s first research into the psychotherapy of hysteria, and their discovery of the therapeutic value of [[abreaction]] (Studies on Hysteria[1895d]). The origin of the hysterical symptom, they asserted, was to be found in a traumatic event which has been met with no corresponding and proportionate discharge of affect (the affect, in other words, remains ‘strangulated’).\n\nIt is only when the recall of the memory brings about the revival of the affect which was originally attached to it that recollection can be effective as therapy.\n\nFreud therefore drew the conclusion from his consideration of hysteria that the affect is not necessarily [[binding|bound]] to the idea; indeed, their separation–an affect without an idea or an idea without an affect–makes them sure to follow different paths. Freud lists three possible lines of development of the affect: ‘I know three mechanisms: transformation of affect (conversion hysteria), displacement of affect (obsessions) and (iii) exchange of affect (anxiety neurosis and melancholia)’ (1).\n\nFrom this period on, the concept of affect is applied in two different ways. At times it has a purely descriptive value, designating the emotional repercussions of an experience–usually a powerful one. Most often, however, its use presupposes a quantitative theory of cathexis–the only theory which can account for the affect’s independence of its various manifestations.\n\nFreud deals with the question systematically in his metapsychological writings–in ‘Repression’ (1915d) and in ‘The Unconscious’ (1915e). The affect is defined as the subjective transposition of the quantity of instinctual energy. Freud makes a clear distinction at this point between the subjective aspect of the affect and the energy-processes which determine it. It will be noticed that, besides the term ‘affect’, he makes use of the expression ‘[[quota of affect]]’ (Affektbetrag) when wanting to place emphasis on the strictly economic aspect: thus the quota of affect ‘corresponds to the instinct in so far as the latter has become detached from the idea and finds expression, proportionate to its quantity, in processes which are sensed as affects’ (2a, α).\n\nIt is hard to see how the term affect could remain intelligible without some reference to self-consciousness. Freud poses the question whether it is legitimate to speak of ‘unconscious affect’ (3a). He rejects any parallel between the supposedly ‘unconscious’ affect–as in unconscious guilt feelings, for example–and unconscious ideas; and he establishes that there is a considerable difference between unconscious ideas and unconscious emotions: ‘…unconscious ideas continue to exist after repression as actual structures in the system Ucs., whereas all that corresponds in that system to unconscious affects is a potential beginning which is prevented from developing’ (3b) (see ‘[[Repression]] and ‘Suppression’).\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that Freud formulated a genetic hypothesis intended to account for that aspect of the affect which is directly experienced. Affects, he suggests, are ‘reproductions of very early, perhaps even pre-individual, experiences of vital importance’ comparable to ‘universal, typical and innate hysterical attacks’ (4).\n(α) In other passages Freud overlooks this distinction: apropos of [[conversion hysteria]], he does not speak of a conversion of the quota of affect determining the disappearance of the subjective affect, but simply of a ‘total disappearance of the quota of affect’ (2b).\n\n(1) FREUD, S., Anf., 95; S.E., 1,188.\n(2) FREUD, S. ‘Repression’ (1915d): a) G.W., X, 255; S.E., XIV, 152. b) G.W., X, 258; S.E., XIV, 155.\n(3) FREUD, S. ‘The Unconscious’ (1915e): a) Cf.

This he situates in the primary object-choice of the child in its love for the person who tends and feeds it. This type of love has erotic components from the outset, but to begin with these are not separable from the satisfaction obtained from nourishment and care of the body (see ‘Anaclisis’).\nOn the other hand, the ‘[[sexuality|sensual]] or, properly speaking, the sexual trend may be defined, in childhood, by the fact that erotic pleasure is at first diverted from the object laid down for it by the vital needs and becomes auto-erotic (see ‘Sexuality’).\nDuring the [[latency period]], owing to repression, the sexual aims undergo a sort of softening effect, and this serves to reinforce the affectionate trend. With the instinctual pressure of puberty, ‘the powerful “sensual” current […] no longer mistakes its aims’. Only gradually will the sexual objects be able to ‘attract to themselves the affection that was tied to earlier ones’ (1).\n\n(1) FREUD, S., G.W., VIII, 80–81; S.E., XI, 181.\n","lastmodified":"2022-05-24T13:48:18.782368329Z","tags":null},"/notes/Agency":{"title":"Agency","content":"= D.: Instanz..–Es.: instancia.–Fr: instance.–I.: instanza.–P.: instância.\n\nIn the context of a view of the [[Psychical (or Psychic or Mental) Apparatus|psychical apparatus]] that is topographical and dynamic, one or other of the various substructures of this apparatus. Examples would be: the agency of the [[Censorship]] (first topography), the agency of the [[Super-Ego]] (second topography).\n\nFreud’s different expositions of his conception of the psychical apparatus generally use the terms ‘system’ (System) and ‘agency’ to designate the parts or substructures of this apparatus. More rarely, we find the words ‘organisation’ (Organisation), ‘formation’ (Bildung) and ‘province’ (Provinz).\n\nThe earliest of these terms used by Freud was ‘system’ (1): it referred to an essentially [[Topography; Topographical|topographical]] plan of the psyche, which was pictured as a series of devices through which excitations passed just as light passes through the different ‘systems’ of an optical apparatus. The term ‘agency’ appears for the first time in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a) as a synonym for ‘system’ (2a); Freud was still using it in his last works (3).\n\nAlthough these two terms are often used interchangeably, it is worth noting that while ‘system’ refers to a more exclusively topographical approach, ‘agency’ has both a topographical and a [[Dynamic]] meaning. Freud speaks for example of mnemic systems (2b), of the perception-consciousness system–and not, in such cases, of agencies. Conversely, he speaks more readily of agencies when dealing with the super-ego or the censorship, in that they exert a positive action and are not defined simply as the points through which excitations pass; thus the superego, for example, is looked upon as the heir of the ‘parental agency’ (4). It is further of note that when Freud introduces the term ‘agency’–literally ‘instance’, understood in a sense, as Strachey notes, ‘similar to that in which the word occurs in the phrase “a Court of the First Instance” ’–he introduces it by analogy with tribunals or authorities which judge what may or may not pass (2c).\n\nIn so far as such a fine distinction is legitimate, the term ‘system’ is closer to the spirit of the first Freudian topography, while ‘agency’ is better fitted to the needs of the second model of the psychical apparatus, which is at once more structural and more dynamic.\n\n(1) Cf.

Although the analysis of ‘Little Hans’ had at that time just displayed the importance and extent of aggressive tendencies and behaviour, Freud declined to make these a function of a specific ‘aggressive instinct’: ‘I cannot bring myself to assume the existence of a special aggressive instinct alongside of the familiar instincts of self-preservation and sex, and on an equal footing with them’ (2). The concept of an aggressive instinct, Freud felt, would tend without justification to monopolise the essential character of instinct in general (see ‘Aggressiveness’).\nFreud’s later adoption of the term ‘Aggressionstrieb’, starting with Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920g), comes in the context of his dualistic theory of the life and death instincts.\nA textual examination of Freud’s writings, though it cannot establish an absolutely unequivocal sense of this term, nor precise lines of demarcation between the death instinct*, the destructive instinct* and the aggressive instinct, does confirm that Freud rarely speaks of an aggressive instinct except in a restricted sense: for the most part, the term designates the death instincts directed outwards.\n\n(1) Cf.

Psycho-analysis has gradually come to give great importance to aggressiveness, showing it to be at work in the early stages of the subject’s development and bringing out the complicated ebb and flow of its fusion with, and defusion from, [[sexuality]]. The culmination of this increasing stress on aggressiveness is the attempt to find a single and basic instinctual underpinning for it in the idea of the [[death instincts|death instinct]].\n\nThere is a school of thought which holds that Freud admitted the importance of aggressiveness only at a very late point. Partisans of this view quote Freud himself in support of their claim: ‘Why have we ourselves needed such a long time before we decided to recognise an [[aggressive instinct]]? Why did we hesitate to make use, on behalf of our theory, of facts which were obvious and familiar to everyone?’ (la). These two questions, however, deserve to be treated separately; it is perfectly true that the hypothesis of an autonomous ‘aggressive instinct’ (proposed by Adler as early as 1908) was for a long time rejected by Freud, but it is nevertheless mistaken to suggest that psycho-analytic theory declined to take aggressive behaviour into account until the ‘turning-point’ of 1920.\n\nIt is easy to show just how aware of aggressiveness Freud was in a number of areas. In the first place, in the course of treatment, he had very soon encountered the aggressiveness which is the mark of [[resistance]]: ‘… what was to begin with such an excellent, honest fellow, becomes low, untruthful and defiant, and a malingerer–till I tell him so and thus make it possible to overcome this character’ (2). In discussing the case of ‘Dora’ (‘Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria’ [1905c]), Freud goes much further and treats the emergence of aggressiveness as an essential feature of the psycho-analytic treatment: under other forms of treatment, ‘a patient will call up affectionate and friendly transferences to help towards his recovery [...], In psycho-analysis, on the other hand, […] all the patient’s motives, including hostile ones, are aroused; they are then turned to account for the purposes of the analysis by being made conscious’ (3). From the outset transference became evident to Freud in the form of resistance–a resistance largely due to what he was to call negative transference (see Transference’).\n\nClinical experience leaves no doubt that in certain conditions, such as obsessional neurosis and paranoia, hostile tendencies are especially significant. Freud introduces the term ‘[[Ambivalence]]’ to denote the coexistence of love and hate–if not at the most fundamental metapsychological level, then at least in experience. It is worth recalling Freud’s analysis of jokes, where he has this to say: ‘Where a joke is not an aim in itself–that is,. where it is not an innocent one–there are only two purposes that it may serve […]. It is either a hostile joke (serving the purpose of aggressiveness, satire or defence) or an obscene joke’ (4).\n\nFreud speaks several times in this connection of ‘hostile impulses’ or of a ‘hostile trend’. And the [[Oedipus complex]], from the moment of its introduction, is conceived of as a combination of loving and hostile wishes–indeed its first exposition, in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a), comes under the heading of ‘Dreams of the Death of Persons of whom the Dreamer is Fond’. Each step in the progressive elaboration of the Oedipus-complex theory represents an attempt to grasp more fully the interplay between these two kinds of wish within the various forms taken on by the complex.\nThe variety, range and importance of these phenomena called for an explanation consistent with the first instinct theory. Schematically, Freud’s response to this demand may be said to have several tiers:\n\na. He declines to postulate a specific instinct to account for these aggressive tendencies and behaviour. It is his view that this would amount to an attribution to a single instinct of something which is in fact the essential characteristic of instinct in general–namely, the fact of its being an inescapable pressure which requires a certain amount of work from the psychical apparatus and which activates motricity. In this sense, if an instinct is to achieve its aims–even where these are ‘passive’ (to be loved, to be looked at, etc.)–an activity is required which may have to overcome obstacles: ‘every instinct is a piece of activity’ (5a).\n\nb. In the first instinct theory, it will be recalled, the [[sexual instinct|sexual instincts]] stand opposed to the [[instincts of self-preservation]]. The latter, generally speaking, have as their function the maintenance and affirmation of the individual’s existence. In this theoretical context an explanation of behaviour or feelings as manifestly aggressive as sadism or hate, say, is sought in a complicated interplay between the two great classes of instincts. To read ‘Instincts and their Vicissitudes’ (1915c) is to realise that Freud does have a metapsychological theory of aggressiveness at his disposal at this point. The apparent turning-round of love into hate is a mere illusion: hate is not a negative form of love, for it has its own genesis, which Freud expounds in all its complexity, his central thesis being that ‘the true prototypes of the relation of hate are derived not from sexual life, but from the ego’s struggle to preserve and maintain itself (5b).\n\nc. Finally, in dealing with the self-preservative instincts Freud singles out the activity of assuring mastery over the object, sometimes as a function, sometimes as an autonomous instinct in its own right (see ‘Instinct to Master’[Bemächtigungstrieb]). This concept is seemingly intended to cover an intermediate area lying between the simple activity intrinsic to any function and a trend towards destruction for the sake of destruction. The instinct to master is an independent instinct bound to a specific apparatus (the musculature) and to a specific developmental stage (the [[Anal-Sadistic Stage (or Phase)|anal-sadistic stage]]). But at the same time, ‘injury or annihilation of the object is a matter of indifference’ (5c) to this urge for mastery: the other person and his suffering will only be taken into consideration with the turning-round towards masochism, at which point the instinct to master can no longer be distinguished from the sexual excitation which it arouses (see ‘Sadism/ Masochism’).\n\n* * *\n\nIn the final instinct theory aggressiveness plays a more considerable part and comes to occupy a different position.\nFreud’s explicit theoretical statements regarding aggressiveness are summed up by the following passage: ‘A portion [of the death instinct] is placed directly in the service of the sexual function, where it has an important part to play. This is sadism proper. Another portion does not share in this transposition outwards; it remains inside the organism and, with the help of the accompanying sexual excitation […], becomes libidinally bound there. It is in this position that we have to recognise the original, erotogenic masochism’ (6). \n\nFreud as a rule keeps the expression ‘aggressive instinct’ (Aggressionstrieb) for that portion of the death instinct which is directed outwards, with the help, in particular, of the muscular apparatus. It should be remembered that for Freud this aggressive instinct (in the same way perhaps as the tendency towards self-destruction) cannot be conceived of at all without envisaging its fusion with sexuality (see ‘Fusion/Defusion of Instincts’).\nPsycho-analysts are given to conflating the opposition between life instincts and death instincts with that between sexuality and aggressiveness, and Freud himself occasionally endorsed this (1b). Such an assimilation calls, however, for a number of comments:\na. The facts invoked by Freud in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920g) to justify his introduction of the idea of the death instinct are phenomena which give expression to the [[Compulsion to Repeat (Repetition Compulsion)|repetition compulsion]]–and this has no special affinity with aggressive behaviour.\nb. Although it is true that certain phenomena which may be classed as aggressive become more and more significant in Freud’s eyes, these are without exception representative of aggression directed against the self: the clinical manifestations of mourning and melancholia, [[Sense of Guilt, Guilt Feeling|‘unconscious guilt feelings’]], the ‘[[negative therapeutic reaction]]’, etc.–such are the phenomena that bring Freud to talk of the ‘mysterious masochistic trends of the ego’ (7).\nc. As for the notions involved here, the [[life instincts]] (or [[Eros]]) are certainly far more than just a new label for what has hitherto been referred to as [[sexuality]]. Indeed Freud means for ‘Eros’ to connote the whole group of instincts which create or maintain organic unities, and this group must eventually include not only the sexual instincts in as much as they tend to preserve the species but also the self-preservative instincts, which aim to maintain and assert the existence of the individual.\nd. Similarly, the idea of the [[death instincts|death instinct]] is not simply a generic concept designed to cover indiscriminately everything formerly designated as aggressiveness (and nothing else). As a matter of fact one part of what may be called the struggle for life certainly belongs to Eros. Conversely the death instinct may lay claim (no doubt in a more emphatic way) to that aspect of human sexuality which Freud had recognised as definitive of human [[Wish (Desire)|desire]]: its ineradicability, persistence, unrealistic nature and–from the economic point of view–its tendency to reduce tensions to zero.\n\n* * *\n\nExactly what revisions does the concept of aggressiveness undergo after 1920? The main changes may be summarised as follows:\n\na. The field in which aggressiveness is acknowledged to be at work is broadened. In the first place, the conception of a destructive instinct capable of directing itself first outwards and thence inwards once more allows the alternation of sadism and masochism to be treated as a highly complex reality which can account for many modalities of mental life. Secondly, aggressiveness is no longer evoked only in dealing with relationships with objects and with the self: it is now said to characterise relations between the different psychical agencies (notably the conflict between the super-ego and the ego).\n\nb. By locating the original source of the death instinct in the subject’s own self, by making self-aggression into the very essence of all aggressiveness, Freud explodes the traditional definition of aggressiveness as a mode of relation to others typified by the expression of violence towards them. It is perhaps appropriate in this context to draw attention to the contrast between some of Freud’s declarations on the natural wickedness of man (8) and what is original in his own theory.\n\nc. Lastly, does the final instinct theory permit us to draw a more specific distinction between aggressiveness and activity? Daniel Lagache has noted that ‘on the face of it, the concept of activity would appear to have a much broader extension than that of aggressiveness; all biological or psychological processes are forms of activity, so that, in principle, aggressiveness only covers certain types of activity’ (9). Now, in so far as Freud tends to place everything which can be called vital behaviour in the service of Eros, the question arises of what defines aggressive behaviour; the notion of fusion/defusion helps us to begin answering this question. For this conception does not merely imply that instincts may blend together in varying proportions–it further entails that defusion is basically a triumph for the destructive instinct, in that this instinct’s objective is to break up those unities which it is up to Eros to create and maintain. From this point of view aggressiveness must certainly be seen as a radical force for disorganisation and fragmentation. Naturally these trends have been underscored by those who–with Melanie Klein–insist upon the predominant part played by the aggressive instincts from earliest childhood onwards.\n* * *\n\nIt will be noticed that Freud’s attitude, as outlined above, runs directly counter to the sense acquired in psychology by the terms derived from the root-word ‘aggression’. This is especially true of English usage: in their Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms, English and English note that aggressiveness has come to be used in a much weakened manner, and has so lost all suggestion of hostility that it expresses nothing more than a ‘tendency to be enterprising, energetic, active’; ‘aggressivity’, according to the same authority, has not lost so much of its force and remains closer to ‘aggression’, ‘to aggress’, etc. A final terminological point is that Freud’s mother tongue is able to use the one term ‘Aggression’ to refer to both aggressions in the sense of acts of aggression and aggressiveness as an inclination or state of mind. [Modern English psycho-analysis has of course followed this example: although the Standard Edition uses ‘aggressiveness’, ‘aggression’ is now almost universally accepted.–tr.]\n\n(1) FREUD, S.

He himself points out the difficulty encountered in attempting to make such an account a rigorous one from the metapsychologicai point of view (1). How is such inhibition to be understood? Does it imply a repression of the original [[Aim of the Instinct, Instinctual Aim|aim]] and a [[return of the repressed]]? And how does it stand in relation to sublimation (q.v.)? As regards this last question Freud appears to consider that inhibition is a sort of incipient sublimation, but he is nonetheless at pains to distinguish the two processes: ‘The social instincts belong to a class of instinctual impulses which need not be described as sublimated, though they are closely related to these. They have not abandoned their directly sexual aims, but they are held back by internal resistances from attaining them; they rest content with certain approximations to satisfaction and for that very reason lead to especially firm and permanent attachments between human beings. To this class belong in particular tlae affectionate relations between parents and children, which were originally fully sexual, feelings of friendship, and the emotional ties in marriage which had their origin in sexual attraction’ (2).\n\n(1) Cf.

Yet even when he speaks of the instinct’s ‘final [[Aim of the Instinct, Instinctual Aim|aim]] (Endziet), Freud is referring to a specific aim tied to a specific instinct (2b). Such a final aim may itself be reached via means (or ‘intermediate aims’) that are more or less interchangeable; but Freud asserted the thesis of the specificity of aim of each [[Component (or Partial) Instinct|component instinct]] as early as the Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905d): ‘The sexual aim of the infantile instinct consists in obtaining satisfaction by means of an appropriate stimulation of the [[Erotogenic (or Erogenous) Zone|erotogenic zone]] that has been selected in one way or another’ (lb). This idea seems to stem from the ‘Project for a Scientific Psychology’ (1950a [1895]), where it appears in the form of the ‘[[specific action]]’ which is alone capable of eliminating the internal tension. It is reiterated even more explicitly in the 1915 edition of the Three Essays: ‘What distinguishes the instincts from one another and endows them with specific qualities is their relation to their somatic sources and to their aims’ (1c).\n\nBy the same token these passages posit a close link between the aim and the source, which is generally represented by an erotogenic zone: in infantile sexuality, the ‘sexual aim is dominated by an erotogenic zone’ (1d). Or again: ‘The aim which each of [the sexual instincts] strives for is the attainment of “[[organ-pleasure]]” (Organlust)’ (2c). Thus the aim corresponding to the oral instinct would be the satisfaction associated with the activity of sucking. Conversely, it is through the instinctual aim that we can get to know the instinctual source, in the sense of the organic process which occurs in the erotogenic organ: ‘Although instincts are wholly determined by their origin in a somatic source, in mental life we know them only by their aims. […] Sometimes [the source of the instinct] may be inferred from its aims’ (2d).\n\nThe source is thus seen as the ratio essendi of the aim, and the aim as the ratio cognoscendi of the source. How are we to reconcile this strict reciprocal determination with the existence of those ‘deviations in respect of the sexual aim’ to which Freud devotes a whole chapter of the Three Essays! Freud’s goal in this section is to demonstrate–against the popular view–that [[sexuality]] covers a field very much wider than the adult sexual act which is usually looked upon as normal–i.e. limited to a sole source, namely the genital apparatus, and to a sole aim, namely ‘sexual union, or at all events actions leading in that direction’ (1e). The ‘deviations’ Freud lists are not modifications in the aim of one particular component instinct, but rather the varieties of sexual aims that are possible. These fall under two heads: they are either aims linked to sources–to erotogenic zones–other than the genital region (e.g. kissing, which is linked to the oral zone); or else they are modifications of the sexual act consequent upon a displacement of object. (Thus although Freud places fetishism among the ‘deviations in respect of the aim’, he concedes that it is in fact essentially a ‘deviation in respect of the object’ (1f).)\n\nIn ‘Instincts and their Vicissitudes’ (1915c) the angle of approach is a very different one. Freud’s concern now is not to draw up an inventory of the variants of the sexual aim in general but to show instead how the aim of one specific component instinct can be transformed. With this as his perspective, Freud is led to draw a distinction between the auto-erotic instincts and those instincts which are directed towards the object from the start ([[sadism]] and the ‘scopophi!ic instinct’). For the former, ‘the part played by the organic source is so decisive that, according to a plausible suggestion of Federn and Jekels, the form and function of the organ determine the activity or passivity of the instinctual aim’ (2e). Only for the second type of instinct is that modification of the aim known as ‘[[Reversal into die Opposite]]’ possible (reversal of sadism into masochism and of voyeurism into exhibitionism); but it should be pointed out that this change of aim is once again closely tied to a change of object–namely, the process of ‘[[turning round upon the subject’s own self]]’ (2f).\n\nIn [[sublimation]], the modification of the instinct consists essentially in a change of aim; yet here too this change is conditioned by a transformation of the instinct’s other elements; the object is exchanged, and one instinct is supplanted by another (the replacement being an instinct of self-preservation with which the sexual instinct has been operating in [[Anaclisis; Anaclitic (or Attachment)|anaclisis]]) (1g, 2g).\n\nPlainly, if we confine ourselves to the categories of which the Freudian theory makes explicit use, the notion of the aim must remain in a no-man’s-land between the notions of the source and the object of the instinct. Defined in terms of its close link with the organic source, the instinctual aim takes on a very clear-cut but somewhat feeble meaning: the aim is sucking in the case of the mouth, vision in that of the eye, ‘[[instinct for mastery|mastery]]’ in that of the muscular apparatus, etc. On the other hand, if each type of sexual activity is viewed–as the evolution of psycho-analytic theory encourages us to do–in its relation with the type of object striven after, then the notion of instinctual aim will tend to give way to that of ‘[[Object-Relation(ship)|object-relationship]]’.\n* * *\n\nNo doubt a clearer light will be thrown on the problems besetting the idea of the instinctual aim in Freud’s work once the ambiguities in his concept of instinct itself have been brought out. For Freud places the sexual instinct and the instinct of self-preservation in the same category in spite of the fact that his whole theory of sexuality points to the profound differences which separate them in their functioning and–precisely–in their aims, i.e. in the path each of them follows to satisfaction.\n\nThe aim of a self-preservative instinct can only be conceived as a [[specific action]] which puts an end to a state of tension provoked by need, which can be located in a particular somatic apparatus, and which naturally requires the carrying out of an actual task (e.g. the provision of food). The aim of the sexual instinct, by contrast, is far harder to characterise. Indeed, precisely because this instinct is at first bound up, in anaclisis, with the self-preservative function, and only comes into its own by breaking this bond, it attains satisfaction through an activity which, though it bears the stamp of the vital function that has been its support, is nonetheless deviant, and profoundly perverted, relative to it. This rift becomes the point of emergence of a phantasy-activity that may involve ideational elements often very far removed from the corporeal prototype (see ‘Auto-Erotism’, ‘Anaclisis’, ‘Instinct’, ‘Sexuality’).\n\n\n(1) FREUD, S.

Such delusions are said to be the mark of an adaptation of the ego to the delusional idea: the paranoic’s final state cf delusion is the outcome of an attempt to reduce the contradictions between the primary delusional idea and the logical functioning of thought.\n\n‘Analysis Terminable and Interminable’ (1937c) makes a relatively systematic approach to what had been ‘so indefinitely termed an “alteration of the ego” ’ (1a).\nAs an extension of Anna Freud’s recently published work on the mechanisms of defence (1936), Freud shows how such mechanisms, originally set up to deal with specific internal dangers, may eventually become ‘fixated in the ego’, constituting ‘regular modes of reaction of [the subject’s] character’ (1b) which he will repeat throughout his life, using them like obsolete institutions even after the initial threat has vanished. Once ensconced, such defensive habits result in ‘distortions’ (Verrenkungen) and ‘restrictions’ (Einschrankungen). The work of therapy shows them up particularly clearly: a resistance* is encountered which militates against the uncovering of resistances.\n\nThe alteration of the ego, however, should be compared rather to those behaviour patterns which-as the ethologists have shown on the basis of instinctual behaviour–can operate in vacuo, as it were, and which may even create motivating situations for themselves artificially: the ego ‘finds itself compelled to seek out those situations in reality which can serve as an approximate substitute for the original danger’ (1c). What Freud has in mind here is something other than the direct effects of the defensive conflict upon the ego (the symptom itself could be considered as a modification of the ego–as a foreign body within it; reaction-formation* also modifies the ego).\n\nThese two texts in which Freud speaks of alteration of the ego have more than one aspect in common. In both instances such alteration is conceived of as secondary, as removed from the conflict and from whatever bears the stamp of the unconscious. Viewed in this light, it would seem to pose a particular obstacle to cure, in that the elucidation of the conflict can have little effect on modifications which affect the ego in an irreversible fashion, and which have been likened to lesional troubles of the organism* (2). Further, the reference to psychosis which is central to the earlier of these two texts is also to be found in the second: the ego of every human being, says Freud, ‘approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent’ (1d).\n\n(1) FREUD, S.: a) G.W..XVI, 80; S.E., XXIII, 235. b) G.W., XVI, 83; S.E., XXIII, 237. c) G.W., XVI, 83; S.E., XXIII, 238. d) G.W., XVI, 80; S.E., XXIII, 235.\n(2) Cf.

From the very beginning, as his correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess testifies, Freud had no doubt that he had through an act of heroic and unique courage undertaken to understand in himself, and others, what humans had always sought to repress, mythologise, or rationalise in terms other than the truth of the experience itself. To say what he was discovering, Freud was compelled to borrow the vocabulary of the language as it existed; but Freud had to distort and extend it to yield the meanings and insights he meant it to communicate. Hence a completely new language gradually crystallised in Freud’s hermeneutics of human epistemology. Freud himself was fully and painfully aware that in time the concepts he had so diligently created to establish a new instrument of self-discovery, would get taken over by the vulgar zeal of shallow familiarity.\nWhat Freud in affection had attributed to Lou Andreas–Salomé, Laplanche and Pontalis have with singular devotion and industry turned into an instrument of research and discovery of what Freud’s concepts really entail.

It is based on a number of premisses:\na. Inasmuch as psycho-analysis has reshaped our view of most psychological and psychopathological phenomena, and even of man in general, an alphabetic manual aiming to cover all of its contributions might justifiably include not only libido and transference but also love and dreams, delinquency or surrealism. Our goal has been a quite different one: we have deliberately chosen to analyse the conceptual equipment of psycho-analysis–i.e. the whole set of concepts which it has gradually evolved in order to account for its own discoveries. This book deals, not with everything that psycho-analysis seeks to explain, but with the tools it uses in doing so.\nb. It is now almost three-quarters of a century since psycho-analysis came into being. The psycho-analytical ‘movement’ has had a long and stormy history. Groups of analysts have been formed in many countries where the specificity of cultural factors could hardly have failed to exert an influence upon the actual concepts of the science. Rather than attempt to catalogue what seems, at any rate, to be a great multiplicity of usages, depending on place and time, we have sought to recapture the pristine novelty of Freud’s concepts, now often obscured or lost; consequently we have paid especial attention to their genesis.\nc. This emphasis has led us to take Sigmund Freud’s pioneering work as our basic frame of reference. Any sample, any good cross-section of the massive literature of psycho-analysis clearly reveals how the great majority of its concepts originate in Freud’s own writings. This then is another respect in which this book differs from works of an encyclopaedic nature.\nThe same concern to rediscover the fundamental conceptual contributions of psycho-analysis has meant that some authors other than Freud have had to be considered. Thus–to cite but one instance–we have included a number of concepts introduced by Melanie Klein.\nd. In the area of psychopathology our choices have been governed by three principles:\n(i) The definition of terms coined by psycho-analysis, whether they are still in use (e.g. anxiety neurosis) or not (e.g. retention hysteria).\n(ii) The definition of terms used by psycho-analysis in a way that differs, or which may at times have differed, from the generally accepted psychiatric usage (e.g. paranoia, paraphrenia).\n(iii) The definition of terms which, though doubtless having the same sense for psycho-analysis as for clinical psychiatry, constitute the main axes of analytic nosology (e.g. neurosis, psychosis, perversion). Our aim was in fact to provide at least some points of reference for readers unfamiliar with clinical psychopathology.\n* * *\n\nThe articles are arranged in alphabetical order. In order to indicate the connections between different concepts we have adopted two conventions: an explicit cross-reference to another entry or a q.v. means that the topic under discussion is also broached–and often more thoroughly treated–in the article referred to; an asterisk indicates merely that a term or expression is itself the subject of an article. The reader is thus encouraged to identify for himself the significant links between concepts, and to find his own bearings in the associative networks of the language of psycho-analysis. We hope by this means to have avoided two pitfalls: on the one hand, the arbitrariness that threatens a purely alphabetical classification and, on the other hand, the danger of dogmatism that so often besets expositions of the hypothetical-deductive type. It should thus be possible to discover groupings, internal relationships, and ‘nodal points’ which differ from those upon which systematic presentations of Freud’s teaching are based.\nEach entry comprises a definition and a commentary. The definition seeks to sum up the concept’s accepted meaning as it emerges from its strict usage in psycho-analytic theory. The commentary constitutes the critical portion and the essence of our own work. The method we have applied here might be described under three headings–historical, structural and problematic. As to the historical, we have sought, without restricting ourselves to a strictly chronological presentation, to indicate the origins of each concept and the chief stages in its evolution. In our opinion this search for origins is more than an academic exercise: it is striking to see how the basic concepts are illuminated, how they regain their living contours, their definition, and how the links between them become clear, once they are shown in relation to the experiences which originally brought them into being, and to the problems that have punctuated and shaped their development.\nThough presented separately in the case of each concept, this historical research naturally brings us back to the history of psycho-analytic thought as a whole. Such research must therefore consider the position of each particular element vis-à-vis the overall structure. In some cases this position seems easily ascertained, and is explicitly acknowledged in the psycho-analytical literature. Often, however, similarities, differences and connections, no matter how indispensable they may be if we are to grasp a concept’s originality, are merely implicit. To take some especially eloquent examples: the difference between ‘Trieb’ and ‘Instinkt’, which is vital in understanding psycho-analytic theory, is nowhere formulated by Freud. The contrast between the ‘anaclitic type of object-choice’ and the ‘narcissistic’ type, though adopted by most authors, is often considered without reference to Freud’s assertion which makes its meaning clear–namely, the thesis of the ‘anaclitic’ dependence of the ‘sexual instincts’ upon the ‘self-preservative’ functions. The relationships between ‘narcissism’ and ‘auto-erotism’, without reference to which we can tie down neither of these notions, quickly became obscured even within Freud’s work itself. Lastly, there are a number of structural phenomena which are much more disconcerting: it is not unusual in psycho-analytic theory for the function of specific concepts or groups of concepts to re-emerge at a later stage, transferred on to other components of the system. Only by offering an interpretation can we hope to trace certain constant structures of psycho-analytical thought and experience as they pass through transformations of this kind.\nOur commentary has striven to dispel or at any rate to make plain the ambiguities of the principal notions, to expose their contradictory aspects. Usually these contradictions lead us to a problematic area that can be recognised in actual experience as well as on the level of terminology.\nLess ambitiously, this discussion has also enabled us to air a number of purely semantic problems and to make a number of proposals designed to increase the coherence of psycho-analytical usage.\n\n* * *\n\nAt the head of each entry we have listed the German (D.), Spanish (Es.), French (Fr.), Italian (I.) and Portuguese (P.) equivalents of the term in question.\nNotes and references are placed at the end of each article. Notes are indicated by Greek letters, references by Arabic numerals.","lastmodified":"2022-05-24T13:48:18.782368329Z","tags":null},"/notes/Introduction":{"title":"Introduction","content":"\nBY\nDANIEL LAGACHE\n\n# THE ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF THIS WORK\n\nAversion to psycho-analysis sometimes takes the form of disparaging comments about its terminology. Naturally, psycho-analysts do not endorse the abuse or over-hasty use of technical words as a way of covering up woolly thinking. But psycho-analysis–like any trade or science–needs a special vocabulary of its own. It is hard to see how the novelty of the discoveries and conceptualisations of this discipline, which is a method of investigation and treatment and a theory of the normal and pathological operation of the mental apparatus, could ever have been formulated without resorting to new terms. Moreover, it is true of any scientific discovery that it takes shape not by following the dictates of common sense but by flying in the face of it. The shocking thing about psychoanalysis is less its emphasis on sexuality than its introduction of unconscious phantasy into the theory of the mental functioning of man in his struggle with the world and with himself. Now ordinary language has no words to evoke mental structures and tendencies that do not exist for common sense. It has therefore been necessary to invent a number of terms–somewhere between two and three hundred, depending on the strictness of one’s reading of the texts and one’s criteria of technicality. Apart from direct examination of psycho-analytical writings we have few aids in attempting to grasp the meaning of these expressions: glossaries appended to expository works, definitions proposed by the lexicons and dictionaries that have been published over the last twenty or thirty years–but, to all intents and purposes, no real specialised and complete reference work (1). The nearest approach to the present work to date is Dr Richard F. Sterba’s Handwörterbuch der Psychoanalyse; circumstances brought the composition of this work to a halt at the letter L, and its publication at the entry ‘Grössenwahn,’ ‘I cannot say,’ Dr Sterba has written to me, ‘whether this was due to my megalomania or to Hitler’s.’ Dr Sterba has been kind enough to send me the five published instalments of his work, which are very hard if not impossible to find (Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag, 1936–37).\nA work quite different in conception may also be mentioned, an alphabetically arranged collection of Freudian texts translated into English: N. Fodor and F. Gaynor, Freud: Dictionary of Psychoanalysis, prefaced by Theodor Reik (New York: Philosophical Library, 1950).\nThe technical terminology of psycho-analysis is for the most part the work of Freud; its evolution proceeds in step with the elaboration of his discoveries and his thinking. By contrast with the development of classical psychopathology, Freud borrowed little from Latin and Greek. Of course he did draw from the psychology, psychopathology and neurophysiology of his time, but by and large his words and expressions come from German common usage, for Freud relied on the resources of his own language. Sometimes a faithful translation is difficult and the analytic terminology gives an esoteric impression that the original German text does not, while sometimes the resources of the translator’s language are not fully exploited; in other cases, the very simplicity of Freud’s wording tends to conceal its technicality. But this linguistic problem is only of secondary importance, the real difficulty lies elsewhere. His inventiveness as a writer notwithstanding, Freud showed scant interest in perfecting his vocabulary. We shall not here enumerate the types of difficulties encountered–suffice it to say that the same goes for psycho-analytic phraseology as for many another language: multiplicity of meaning and semantic overlapping are to be found, while different words may not have very different connotations.\nWe are fighting, then, with words–but not for words. Behind the words we have to find facts, ideas, and the conceptual organisation of psycho-analysis. A task made laborious both by the long and fruitful evolution of Freud’s own thought and by the size of a literature which, in catalogue, already fills the nine volumes of Grinstein’s bibliography. Moreover, words, like ideas (and together with ideas), are not merely created–they have a fate: they may fall into disuse or lose their currency, giving way to others which are better suited to the needs of fresh orientations in research and theory. The core of Freud’s terminology has nevertheless stood the test of time: the few new departures that have been made have been assimilated without modifying its organisation or general tone. Consequently, a lexicon such as the present one cannot confine itself to definitions distinguishing between the various meanings that psycho-analytic terms have taken on: the propositions arrived at have to be backed up by a commentary complete with references and quotations.\nThis commentary requires an extensive perusal of the literature, it is true, but what is needed above all is knowledge of the Freudian texts themselves, for all conceptual and terminological development is undoubtedly grounded in them; and moreover the dimensions of the literature will defy the efforts of an invidual researcher or even a small team of coworkers. Next, a work of the kind envisaged cannot be based on erudition alone–it calls for specialists with first-hand knowledge of the psycho-analytic experience. At the same time, though setting our sights beyond words, on the facts and ideas that lie behind them, we must yet avoid the pitfall of producing an encyclopaedia or ‘dictionary of knowledge’. Finally, the task is to take stock of usages, to see what light they cast upon one another, and to highlight the problems they raise without attempting to provide solutions. The need for actual innovation is small, limited to such things as proposing more faithful translations.\nThe method appropriate here is above all a historical-critical one, after the fashion of Andre Lalande’s Vocabulaire technique et critique de la philosophie. Such was our perspective when the notion of a ‘vocabulary of psycho-analysis’ first began taking concrete form around 1937–39. But the data assembled at that time were lost; the circumstances, other tasks, lack of documentation–all meant that the idea lay fallow if not forgotten. Our aims were not completely abandoned, however, in that a variety of projects went forward that dealt to some extent with questions of terminology. Only in 1958 was the original proposal revived; the perspective was still the historical-critical one of Lalande’s Vocabulaire, but the form suggested now was somewhat modified.\nAfter some hesitation, the demands of the task and the desire to carry it through both found an apt response in the collaboration of Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis. They were to devote almost eight years of work to consulting the psycho-analytical literature, reflecting on the basic texts, drafting, revising and polishing articles; obviously, this has been a fruitful labour, but it has also been a demanding and at times even a wearisome one. We read and discussed most of the draft articles together, and I clearly remember the liveliness of those exchanges, whose cordiality did not stop us expressing divergent opinions and adhering to the rule of uncompromising intellectual rigour. Without the pioneering effort of Laplanche and Pontalis the plan formed twenty years ago would never have been realised in this book.\nDuring these years of labour, especially the last ones, the work’s orientation has altered somewhat–a mark not of hesitance but of vitality. Thus Laplanche and Pontalis increasingly centred their research and reflection on Freud’s own writings, referring readily to the earliest psycho-analytic texts including the ‘Project for a Scientific Psychology’ of 1895, which had only just been published (1950a). This added emphasis on the origins of ideas and terms has not, however, reduced the importance accorded to their vicissitudes and their range. So the present work, while it bears the personal stamp of Laplanche and Pontalis, does not betray the principles which inspired the original project.\nThe aim was and remains the answering of a need–a necessity felt by us, acknowledged by others, and hardly ever denied. Our wish is that it may be useful, serving as a work-tool for researchers and students in psycho-analysis as well as for other specialists and for the curious reader. However great the care and conscientiousness which have gone into its compilation, the informed, attentive and demanding reader will doubtless come upon gaps and errors of fact or of interpretation; if such readers communicate their criticisms these will not be set aside but warmly welcomed and studied with interest. Furthermore, neither the object, nor the content, nor the form of the work would appear to stand in the way of its translation. Comments, criticisms and translations will help fulfil a second ambition, which is that this book should become not only a tool but also a record of work in progress.\n\n\n## Note\n\n1 Translator’s note: This situation has been modified recently, with the publication, in particular, of the following works: Charles Rycroft, A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London and New York, 1968); Humberto Nagera (ed.), Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Libido Theory, Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams, Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts, Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on Metapsychology, Conflicts, Anxiety and Other Subjects (London and New York, 1969,1971); Burness E.
