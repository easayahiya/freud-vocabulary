In the specific sense which Freud gives to this term, it means an attitude towards the other person which, as opposed to ‘sensuality’ (Sinnlichkeit), perpetuates or reproduces the earliest mode of the child’s love-relationship, where sexual pleasure is not attained independently but always stands in an anaclitic relation to the satisfaction of the instincts of self-preservation.
It was in analysing one particular type of amorous behaviour (in ‘On the Universal Tendency to Debasement in the Sphere of Love’ ([1912d]) that Freud came to make a distinction between a “sensual trend” and an ‘affectionate trend’ in so far as they appeared in clinical experience as separated from one another (see ‘Genital Love’).
Freud is less concerned with describing the manifestations of affection than with tracing its origin. This he situates in the primary object-choice of the child in its love for the person who tends and feeds it. This type of love has erotic components from the outset, but to begin with these are not separable from the satisfaction obtained from nourishment and care of the body (see ‘Anaclisis’).
On the other hand, the ‘[[sexuality|sensual]] or, properly speaking, the sexual trend may be defined, in childhood, by the fact that erotic pleasure is at first diverted from the object laid down for it by the vital needs and becomes auto-erotic (see ‘Sexuality’).
During the [[latency period]], owing to repression, the sexual aims undergo a sort of softening effect, and this serves to reinforce the affectionate trend. With the instinctual pressure of puberty, ‘the powerful “sensual” current […] no longer mistakes its aims’. Only gradually will the sexual objects be able to ‘attract to themselves the affection that was tied to earlier ones’ (1).
