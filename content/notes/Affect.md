= D.: Affekt.–Es.: afecto.–Fr.: affect.–I.: affetto.–P.: afeto.

Term borrowed by psycho-analysis from German psychological usage. It connotes any affective state, whether painful or pleasant, whether vague or well defined, and whether it is manifested in the form of a massive discharge or in the form of a general mood. According to Freud, each instinct expresses itself in terms of affect and in terms of [[Idea (or Presentation or Representation)|ideas]] (Vorstellungen). The affect is the qualitative expression of the quantity of instinctual energy and of its fluctuations.

The notion of affect takes on a great deal of importance as early as Breuer’s and Freud’s first research into the psychotherapy of hysteria, and their discovery of the therapeutic value of [[abreaction]] (Studies on Hysteria[1895d]). The origin of the hysterical symptom, they asserted, was to be found in a traumatic event which has been met with no corresponding and proportionate discharge of affect (the affect, in other words, remains ‘strangulated’).

It is only when the recall of the memory brings about the revival of the affect which was originally attached to it that recollection can be effective as therapy.

Freud therefore drew the conclusion from his consideration of hysteria that the affect is not necessarily [[binding|bound]] to the idea; indeed, their separation–an affect without an idea or an idea without an affect–makes them sure to follow different paths. Freud lists three possible lines of development of the affect: ‘I know three mechanisms: transformation of affect (conversion hysteria), displacement of affect (obsessions) and (iii) exchange of affect (anxiety neurosis and melancholia)’ (1).

From this period on, the concept of affect is applied in two different ways. At times it has a purely descriptive value, designating the emotional repercussions of an experience–usually a powerful one. Most often, however, its use presupposes a quantitative theory of cathexis–the only theory which can account for the affect’s independence of its various manifestations.

Freud deals with the question systematically in his metapsychological writings–in ‘Repression’ (1915d) and in ‘The Unconscious’ (1915e). The affect is defined as the subjective transposition of the quantity of instinctual energy. Freud makes a clear distinction at this point between the subjective aspect of the affect and the energy-processes which determine it. It will be noticed that, besides the term ‘affect’, he makes use of the expression ‘[[quota of affect]]’ (Affektbetrag) when wanting to place emphasis on the strictly economic aspect: thus the quota of affect ‘corresponds to the instinct in so far as the latter has become detached from the idea and finds expression, proportionate to its quantity, in processes which are sensed as affects’ (2a, α).

It is hard to see how the term affect could remain intelligible without some reference to self-consciousness. Freud poses the question whether it is legitimate to speak of ‘unconscious affect’ (3a). He rejects any parallel between the supposedly ‘unconscious’ affect–as in unconscious guilt feelings, for example–and unconscious ideas; and he establishes that there is a considerable difference between unconscious ideas and unconscious emotions: ‘…unconscious ideas continue to exist after repression as actual structures in the system Ucs., whereas all that corresponds in that system to unconscious affects is a potential beginning which is prevented from developing’ (3b) (see ‘[[Repression]] and ‘Suppression’).

Finally, it is worth noting that Freud formulated a genetic hypothesis intended to account for that aspect of the affect which is directly experienced. Affects, he suggests, are ‘reproductions of very early, perhaps even pre-individual, experiences of vital importance’ comparable to ‘universal, typical and innate hysterical attacks’ (4).
(α) In other passages Freud overlooks this distinction: apropos of [[conversion hysteria]], he does not speak of a conversion of the quota of affect determining the disappearance of the subjective affect, but simply of a ‘total disappearance of the quota of affect’ (2b).
