In the context of a view of the [[Psychical (or Psychic or Mental) Apparatus|psychical apparatus]] that is topographical and dynamic, one or other of the various substructures of this apparatus. Examples would be: the agency of the [[Censorship]] (first topography), the agency of the [[Super-Ego]] (second topography).

Freud’s different expositions of his conception of the psychical apparatus generally use the terms ‘system’ (System) and ‘agency’ to designate the parts or substructures of this apparatus. More rarely, we find the words ‘organisation’ (Organisation), ‘formation’ (Bildung) and ‘province’ (Provinz).

The earliest of these terms used by Freud was ‘system’ (1): it referred to an essentially [[Topography; Topographical|topographical]] plan of the psyche, which was pictured as a series of devices through which excitations passed just as light passes through the different ‘systems’ of an optical apparatus. The term ‘agency’ appears for the first time in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a) as a synonym for ‘system’ (2a); Freud was still using it in his last works (3).

Although these two terms are often used interchangeably, it is worth noting that while ‘system’ refers to a more exclusively topographical approach, ‘agency’ has both a topographical and a [[Dynamic]] meaning. Freud speaks for example of mnemic systems (2b), of the perception-consciousness system–and not, in such cases, of agencies. Conversely, he speaks more readily of agencies when dealing with the super-ego or the censorship, in that they exert a positive action and are not defined simply as the points through which excitations pass; thus the superego, for example, is looked upon as the heir of the ‘parental agency’ (4). It is further of note that when Freud introduces the term ‘agency’–literally ‘instance’, understood in a sense, as Strachey notes, ‘similar to that in which the word occurs in the phrase “a Court of the First Instance” ’–he introduces it by analogy with tribunals or authorities which judge what may or may not pass (2c).

In so far as such a fine distinction is legitimate, the term ‘system’ is closer to the spirit of the first Freudian topography, while ‘agency’ is better fitted to the needs of the second model of the psychical apparatus, which is at once more structural and more dynamic.
