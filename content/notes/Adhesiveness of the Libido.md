= D.: Klebrigkeit der Libido.–Es. adherencia de la libido.–Fr.: viscosité de la libido.–I.: vischiosità della libido.–P.: viscosidade da libido.

Property postulated by Freud to account for the libido’s variable capacity for [[fixation]] to an object or at a stage, and for the variable facility with which it can shift its cathexes once these have become established. Adhesiveness is said to vary from individual to individual.
In Freud’s writings several kindred terms are used to designate this property of the libido: Haftbarkeit (adhesiveness) or Fähigkeit zur Fixierung (susceptibility to fixation), Zähigkeit (pertinacity), Klebrigkeit (viscosity), Trägheit (inertia).
The last two terms in this list are those most readily called upon by Freud. It is noteworthy that words like ‘viscosity’ and ‘adhesiveness’ evoke the Freudian image of the libido as a flow of liquid. In introducing the idea of the fixation of libido in the Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905d), Freud assumes the existence of a factor which, taken in conjunction with an accidental experience, is able to explain the intensity of a fixation (see ‘Complemental Series’): ‘a psychical factor of unknown origin’, ‘an increased pertinacity or susceptibility to fixation’ which is characteristic of ‘these early impressions of sexual life’ (1).
Freud maintains this view all the way through his work. There are two contexts in particular where he sets it forth:
a. On the theoretical level, when the evolution of childhood sexuality and its fixations has to be traced–notably in ‘From the History of an Infantile Neurosis’ (19186 [1914]): ‘Any position of the libido which [the Wolf Man] had once taken up was obstinately defended by him from fear of what he would lose by giving it up and from distrust of the probability of a complete substitute being afforded by the new position that was in view. This is an important and fundamental psychological peculiarity, which I described in my Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality as susceptibility to “fixation” ’ (2a).
b. In the theory of the treatment, where it connotes one of the limits of therapeutic action: ‘The processes which the treatment sets in motion in [certain subjects] are so much slower than in other people because, apparently, they cannot make up their minds to detach libidinal cathexes from one object and displace them on to another, although we can discover no special reason for this cathectic loyalty’ (3).
Freud further notes that an excessive libidinal mobility may create just the reverse problem, in which event the achievements of the treatment may be very precarious.
In the last analysis, then, how does Freud conceive of this viscosity, this susceptibility to fixation which can be a major obstacle in therapy? He sees it as in some way irreducible, as ‘a prime number’ (2b), an element which is unanalysable and which it is impossible to change; for the most part he defines it as a constitutional factor which the process of ageing tends to accentuate.
The adhesiveness of libido seems to bear witness to a sort of psychical inertia analogous to entropy in a physical system: in transformations of psychical energy there is apparently never any way of mobilising a whole quantity of energy that has once become fixated. It is in this sense that Freud uses the Jungian expression ‘psychical inertia’ on occasion, in spite of his stated reservations about the excessive explanatory value accorded this notion by Jung in his account of the aetiology of the neuroses.
