= D.: Ichveranderung.–Es.: alteración delyo.–Fr.: alteration du moi.–I.: modificazione dell’l io.–P.: alteração do ego.

All those restrictions and anachronistic attitudes which the ego adopts in the course of the various stages of the defensive conflict, and which have an unfavourable effect on its ability to adapt.

This expression occurs at the very beginning and at the very end of Freud’s work, in two rather different contexts.

In ‘Further Remarks on the [[Neuro-Psychosis (or Psychoneurosis) of Defence|Neuro-Psychoses of Defence]] (1896b), Freud draws a distinction, apropos of paranoia, between delusions as the [[Return of the Repressed]] and a secondary type, interpretative delusions, also known as ‘combinatory’ and (elsewhere) as ‘assimilatory* delusions. Such delusions are said to be the mark of an adaptation of the ego to the delusional idea: the paranoic’s final state cf delusion is the outcome of an attempt to reduce the contradictions between the primary delusional idea and the logical functioning of thought.

‘Analysis Terminable and Interminable’ (1937c) makes a relatively systematic approach to what had been ‘so indefinitely termed an “alteration of the ego” ’ (1a).
As an extension of Anna Freud’s recently published work on the mechanisms of defence (1936), Freud shows how such mechanisms, originally set up to deal with specific internal dangers, may eventually become ‘fixated in the ego’, constituting ‘regular modes of reaction of [the subject’s] character’ (1b) which he will repeat throughout his life, using them like obsolete institutions even after the initial threat has vanished. Once ensconced, such defensive habits result in ‘distortions’ (Verrenkungen) and ‘restrictions’ (Einschrankungen). The work of therapy shows them up particularly clearly: a resistance* is encountered which militates against the uncovering of resistances.

The alteration of the ego, however, should be compared rather to those behaviour patterns which-as the ethologists have shown on the basis of instinctual behaviour–can operate in vacuo, as it were, and which may even create motivating situations for themselves artificially: the ego ‘finds itself compelled to seek out those situations in reality which can serve as an approximate substitute for the original danger’ (1c). What Freud has in mind here is something other than the direct effects of the defensive conflict upon the ego (the symptom itself could be considered as a modification of the ego–as a foreign body within it; reaction-formation* also modifies the ego).

These two texts in which Freud speaks of alteration of the ego have more than one aspect in common. In both instances such alteration is conceived of as secondary, as removed from the conflict and from whatever bears the stamp of the unconscious. Viewed in this light, it would seem to pose a particular obstacle to cure, in that the elucidation of the conflict can have little effect on modifications which affect the ego in an irreversible fashion, and which have been likened to lesional troubles of the organism* (2). Further, the reference to psychosis which is central to the earlier of these two texts is also to be found in the second: the ego of every human being, says Freud, ‘approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent’ (1d).
