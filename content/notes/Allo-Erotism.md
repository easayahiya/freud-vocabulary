= D.: Alloerotismus.–Es.: aloerotismo. –Fr.: allo-érotisme. –I.: alloerotismo.–P: alo-erotismo.

Term occasionally used as the opposite of ‘auto-erotisra’: sexual activity which finds satisfaction through an external object.

When Freud used the term ‘auto-erotism’ (q.v.) for the first time, in 1899, he coupled it with ‘allo-erotism’–itself subdivisible into ‘homo-erotism’ (satisfaction attained by means of an object of the same sex: homosexuality) and ‘hetero-erotism’ (satisfaction attained by means of an object of the opposite sex: heterosexuality) (1). Though little used, this term was adopted, notably, by Ernest Jones.

(i) Cf. FREUD, S., Anf., 324; S.E., I, 280.
