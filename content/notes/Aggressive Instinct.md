It was Alfred Adler who introduced the idea of an aggressive instinct in 1908 (1), along with the notion of Triebverschränkung or ‘instinctual confluence’ (see ‘Fusion/Defusion’). Although the analysis of ‘Little Hans’ had at that time just displayed the importance and extent of aggressive tendencies and behaviour, Freud declined to make these a function of a specific ‘aggressive instinct’: ‘I cannot bring myself to assume the existence of a special aggressive instinct alongside of the familiar instincts of self-preservation and sex, and on an equal footing with them’ (2). The concept of an aggressive instinct, Freud felt, would tend without justification to monopolise the essential character of instinct in general (see ‘Aggressiveness’).
Freud’s later adoption of the term ‘Aggressionstrieb’, starting with Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920g), comes in the context of his dualistic theory of the life and death instincts.
A textual examination of Freud’s writings, though it cannot establish an absolutely unequivocal sense of this term, nor precise lines of demarcation between the death instinct*, the destructive instinct* and the aggressive instinct, does confirm that Freud rarely speaks of an aggressive instinct except in a restricted sense: for the most part, the term designates the death instincts directed outwards.
