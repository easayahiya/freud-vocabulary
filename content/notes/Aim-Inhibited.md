Qualifies an instinct which as a result of either external or internal obstacles fails to achieve its direct mode of satisfaction (or aim), but which obtains an attenuated satisfaction from activities or relationships that may be considered as approximations more or less far-removed from the original aim.

It is especially in order to account for the origin of feelings of affection (q.v.) or social feelings that Freud uses the concept of aim-inhibition. He himself points out the difficulty encountered in attempting to make such an account a rigorous one from the metapsychologicai point of view (1). How is such inhibition to be understood? Does it imply a repression of the original [[Aim of the Instinct, Instinctual Aim|aim]] and a [[return of the repressed]]? And how does it stand in relation to sublimation (q.v.)? As regards this last question Freud appears to consider that inhibition is a sort of incipient sublimation, but he is nonetheless at pains to distinguish the two processes: ‘The social instincts belong to a class of instinctual impulses which need not be described as sublimated, though they are closely related to these. They have not abandoned their directly sexual aims, but they are held back by internal resistances from attaining them; they rest content with certain approximations to satisfaction and for that very reason lead to especially firm and permanent attachments between human beings. To this class belong in particular tlae affectionate relations between parents and children, which were originally fully sexual, feelings of friendship, and the emotional ties in marriage which had their origin in sexual attraction’ (2).
