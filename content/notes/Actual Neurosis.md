= D.: Aktualneurose.–Es.: neurosis actual.–Fr,: névrose actuelle.–I.: nevrosi attuale.–P.: neurose atual.

A type of neurosis which Freud distinguishes from the [[psychoneurosis|psychoneuroses]]:
a. The origin of the actual neuroses is not to be found in infantile conflicts, tot in the present.
b. The symptoms here, instead of being a symbolic and overdetermined from of expression, are the direct outcome of the absence or inadequacy of sexual satisfaction.

At first Freud considered that [[anxiety neurosis]] and [[neurasthenia]] made up the actual neuroses, but he later proposed that hypochondria should be counted among them.
The term ‘actual neurosis’ appears for the first time in Freud’s work in 1898, when it is used to denote anxiety neurosis and neurasthenia (1a). The idea that these conditions were to be set apart from the other neuroses had been developed much earlier, however, during his researches into the aetiology of the neuroses, as can be seen from both the correspondence with Fliess (2) and the writings of 1894–96 (3).
a. The opposition between the actual neuroses and the psychoneuroses is essentially aetiological and pathogenic: the cause is definitely sexual in both these types of neurosis, but in the former case it must be sought in ‘a disorder of [the subject’s] contemporary sexual life’ and not in ‘important events in his past life’ (4). The adjective ‘actual’ is therefore to be understood first and foremost in the sense of temporal ‘actuality’ (1b) [a sense which has largely been abandoned by modern English usage–tr.]. In addition, this aetiology is somatic rather than psychical: ‘…the source of excitation, the precipitating cause of the disturbance, lies in the somatic field instead of the psychical one, as is the case in hysteria and obsessional neurosis’ (5). In anxiety neurosis, this precipitating cause is considered to be the non-discharge of sexual excitation, while in neurasthenia it is the incomplete satisfaction of it, as in masturbation, which is held to be responsible.
Lastly, the mechanism of [[symptom-formation]] is taken to be somatic in the actual neuroses (as when there is a direct transformation of the excitation into anxiety); so that ‘actual’ connotes the absence of the mediations which are to be encountered in the symptom-formation of the psychoneuroses (displacement, condensation, etc.).
From the therapeutic standpoint, the upshot of these views is that the actual neuroses cannot be treated psycho-analytically because their symptoms do not have a meaning that can be elucidated (6).
Freud never abandons this position in respect of the actual neuroses. He puts it forward on a number of occasions, remarking that the explanation of the mechanism of symptom-formation in these cases can be left to the chemical sciences (intoxication of the sexual substances by products of the metabolism) (7).
b. There is, in Freud’s view, more than an overall antithesis opposing the psychoneuroses to the actual neuroses: he attempts several times to establish a thoroughgoing isomorphism between neurasthenia and anxiety neurosis on the one hand and the various [[transference neurosis|transference neuroses]] on the other. When he later introduces hypochondria into the class of the actual neuroses (8), he sees it as corresponding to the [[paraphrenia|paraphrenias]] or [[narcissistic libido|narcissistic neuroses]] (schizophrenia and paranoia). These parallels are not justified only by structural analogies, but also by the fact that ‘a symptom of an “actual” neurosis is often the nucleus and first stage of a [[symptom-formation|psychoneurotic symptom]] (9). The idea that psychoneurosis is precipitated by frustration leading to the damming-up of the libido serves in effect to emphasize the presence of the ‘actual’ element (10).
* * *

The concept of actual neurosis is tending to disappear from present-day nosography. This is due to the fact that it is always possible–however important the actual factors may be as precipitating causes–to detect the symbolic expression of older conflicts in the symptoms. Which said, the idea of actual conflicts and symptoms has conserved its utility; it is an idea which calls for some comment:
a. Psycho-analytic practice brings out the necessity to distinguish between those conflicts of infantile origin which are reactualised, and those which are principally determined by an actual (present) situation: the existence of an acute actual conflict can often present an obstacle to progress in the course of the psycho-analytic treatment.
b. In every psychoneurosis a longer or shorter catalogue of symptoms will be met with, alongside those with an explicable significance, which are of the type described by Freud in the context of the actual neuroses: unjustifiable fatigue, vague pains and so on. Where the defensive conflict is preventing the fulfilment of unconscious wishes, it is conceivable that this libido which has not been satisfied is at the root of a certain number of non-specific symptoms.
c. To pursue this line of thought, it may be remarked that according to Freud’s view of the matter ‘actual’ symptoms are chiefly somatic in character, so that the old idea of actual neurosis leads directly to the present-day conception of psychosomatic troubles.
d. As a last point, it is worth noting that it is only the lack of satisfaction of the sexual instincts which is taken into consideration by Freud’s theory. In attempting to understand the genesis of actual and psychosomatic symptoms, we should be well advised to pay some attention too to the suppression of aggressiveness.
